## sections, you can place these variables also directly there

## replace with e.g. "localhost" to run against local software

## uncomment the port to use something other than 80
# port = 8089

## all the buckets created will start with this prefix;
## {random} will be filled with random characters to pad
## the prefix to 30 characters long, and avoid collisions
